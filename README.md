This project is a second attempt at building an airport. [Ruby Airport](https://www.github.com/FayeCarter/airport_challenge).

## Aims of the project

- [ ] A plan can land at an airport
      As an air traffic controller 
      So I can get passengers to a destination 
      I want to instruct a plane to land at an airport

- [ ] A plane leaves an airport when in takeOff
      As an air traffic controller 
      So I can get passengers on the way to their destination 
      I want to instruct a plane to take off from an airport and confirm that it is no longer in the airport

- [ ] Airports can be full
      As an air traffic controller 
      To ensure safety 
      I want to prevent landing when the airport is full 

- [ ] Airport capacity can be set     
      As the system designer
      So that the software can be used for many different airports
      I would like a default airport capacity that can be overridden as appropriate

- [ ] Stormy weather prevents takeOff
      As an air traffic controller 
      To ensure safety 
      I want to prevent takeoff when weather is stormy 

- [ ] Stormy weather prevents landing
      As an air traffic controller 
      To ensure safety 
      I want to prevent landing when weather is stormy
